# To Do

- [ ] Add script to check the samplesheet is in the correct format and the paths
provided exist.

- [ ] Update the resource requests in `base.config` or 
`nextflow-singularity.config` to be more appropriate for the full dataset.

- [ ] Write a script that generates a `samplesheet.csv` from a directory of
fastq files.
